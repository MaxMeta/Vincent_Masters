# Vincent_Masters
Here are the scripts that Vincent Nowak wrote/used for his Masters thesis.

Some yet unpublished results are included. This in particular refers to the BiG-SCAPE output of the 6 Tongan sponges analysed as part of this thesis as well as some of the summary statistics included in the two readme files.
